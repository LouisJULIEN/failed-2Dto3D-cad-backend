# small-2Dto3D-cad-backend
The goal is to make a 3D model from 2D projections. It currently works for a squares and pyramids, more complex test case to follow.
Vertices and edges can hide each other in 2D projection (e.g. a 1x1x1 square). We handle that.
Frontend is small-2Dto3D-cad-frontend, go there for screenshots.

# Working principles
Faces and solids are not part of this project as they can hide vertices and edges.
